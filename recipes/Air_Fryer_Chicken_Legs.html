    <h3> What Is This Recipe?</h3>
    <P>To make these air fryer chicken legs—crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside—all you need is 5 ingredients and an air fryer. These chicken drumsticks are quick, easy, and seasoned just right.</P>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <l1>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</l1>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 skin-on chicken drumsticks</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Combine garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Place drumsticks on a clean work surface. Sprinkle spice mix evenly over all sides of the drumsticks.</li>
        <li>Place drumsticks in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 10 minutes. Using tongs, flip chicken over and cook for 10 minutes more. Rest for 5 minutes before serving. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
